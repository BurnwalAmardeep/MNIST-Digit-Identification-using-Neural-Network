MNIST Digit(0-9) Identification using Neural Network

# Problem Statement
Implementation of an L-layered deep neural network and training it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology. Identification of handwritten digit using Neural Network.
